IMAGE SOURCES & NOTES

I found public/online images for some attractions (Wikimedia / local listings). Replace the placeholders with real photos below or your own images.

Suggested steps to replace:
1. Save your image files with the same filenames in /images (e.g., attr_1.jpg, attr_2.jpg).
2. Update the <img src="images/attr_1.svg"> to .jpg/.png if needed.
3. Re-open index.html.

Sample places where public images may exist (search these on Google/Wikimedia):
- "St. Stephen Protomartyr Church Ligao" (Wikimedia Commons)
- "Divine Mercy Shrine Ligao" (local sites / Wikimedia)
- "Ilah Nature Park Ligao" (villagepipol, lookph)
- "Kawa-kawa Hill Ligao" (trip moments, local blogs)

If you want, I can:
- Automatically replace placeholders with the actual public image URLs I found,
- or download and embed images directly into the ZIP (I can do that on request).
